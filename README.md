# Nldraw (WIP)

## Description

This project is a quick note-taking and sketching tool built on top of the
[tldraw](https://tldraw.com) library. It provides a simple interface for users
to jot down notes and create sketches on-the-go. With a focus on offline usage,
this tool allows users to store and access their data locally, eliminating the
need for constant communication with a remote server. Whether you're in a remote
area with limited internet connectivity or simply prefer to keep your data
local, this project offers the flexibility to work offline using the local
filesystem.

Please note that this project is intended for personal use and experimentation.
It is not actively maintained, and none of the features mentioned in the roadmap
are currently scheduled for development.
